# Welcome to my blog

## Intention

From time to time I like to write about one of my projects, new technologies I am interested in or concepts I have tried. The main focus of this blog lays on software engineering.



## Reasons

There are two main reasons why I have created this blog:

Firstly, I want to share my knowledge about various topics.

Secondly, these posts help me reflect on my learning progress as well as consolidating the new skills I have learned.
