          </h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            The AzDM App is being created during the course of my diploma thesis
            and it generates music recommendations based on the local songs
            stored on your smartphone. </br>
            You can listen to songs stored on you smartphone, get music recommendations by selecting genres you like and use the
            music map to see where in the world people hear the same music as you.

            <a>KAP-Tool - Synchronization Add-In for Outlook</a>
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            KAP-Tool is an Outlook Add-In, which offers various functions for the synchronization 
            of work tasks between the system "WinLine" and Outlook. </br>
            The work items are displayed in the Outlook calendar. If a task has been modified in the calendar, 
            this change will be detected and synchronized with WinLine.
            In addition, a warning is issued if too many tasks were scheduled on a day and thus the working time was exceeded.
