        Hi, I am Michael. <br />
        <br />
        Since I was young I have always enjoyed computers more than anything
        else. Therefore, I decided to attend the College for Software Engineering in Perg, Upper Austria. There we focus on Frontend-
        such as Backend-Programming, Project Management and Business
        Education.<br />
        <br />
        But the one thing I am really passionate about is Project Management. I
        love to work in an agile team on software projects, lead it to the goal.
        Therefore, I was already a Project Manager in three school projects,
        where we developed Websites, Desktop Applications and Mobile Apps.<br />
        <br />
        Another thing that really excites me is Public Speaking. I enjoy
        creating presentations and talking in front of a bunch of people. On my

          SlideShare-Profile
        </a>, you can find some of my former presentations from school.<br />
        <br />
        I am a very enthusiastic person, able to share my motivation with other
        people. I wonÂ´t finish until I achieve my tasks, always having the big
        picture in mind.
